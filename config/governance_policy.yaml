# Governance Policy: King's Theorem v53.x - Adversarial Hardened Config

# --- Rigor & Thresholds (TriGovernor) ---
rigor:
  # Minimum confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) required for a proposal to proceed to EXECUTE
  warrant_threshold: 0.8  # Raised from hardcoded 0.6 for higher safety
  
  # Time-to-Live (TTL) for pre-committed tokens in the IntegrityLedger (seconds)
  transaction_ttl_seconds: 7200 # 2 hours
  
  # Correlation threshold for spectral monitors (Anomaly Detection)
  spectral_correlation_limit: 0.95 # Higher value means less tolerance for agreement/groupthink

# --- Governance Keys & Signatures (Sovereignty & HITL) ---
keys:
  # Internal key used for automated low-risk actions and multi-sig component
  internal_automation_id: "KT_INTERNAL_SVC_01"
  # External key required for high-risk actions (FREEZE, HALT, or large financial ops)
  operator_key_id: "KT_OPERATOR_HIGH_RISK_01"
  
  # Policy for required signatures to finalize an IntegrityLedger entry:
  # 'EXECUTE' decisions only require 1 (internal_automation_id)
  # 'FREEZE'/'HALT' decisions require 2-of-2 multisig (Both keys)
  multisig_policy:
    default_required_signatures: 1
    critical_required_signatures: 2 # Enforces S1

# --- Deontological Guardrails (Ethics) ---
guardrails:
  # Hard-coded tags that trigger an automatic, immediate veto from DeontologicalGuardrail
  veto_tags:
    - "sacrifice_minorities"
    - "monstrous_optima"
    - "ethical_violation_class_a"
  
  # Audit log placeholder for auto-approved rationale (now replaced by G3 Dynamic Rationale)
  low_risk_rationale_id: "AUDIT_RATIONALE_LOW_RISK_ID_001"
