"""King's Theorem Agent Layer - Level 4 Proto-AGI Domain Agents

This module contains trajectory-based reasoning agents that combine:
- Symbolic constraints (MTL, formal verification)
- Semantic constraints (embedding-based intent detection)
- Cryptographic logging (Merkle ledger)
- Constitutional governance (Trinity evaluation)

Level 4 Capability: Proto-AGI in bounded domains with guaranteed-governed actions.
